# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack application designed to simulate a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project focuses on backend architecture, database design, API development, and security.

## Project Goals
- Develop a scalable backend system for users, bookings, properties, and reviews.
- Implement a secure API for client applications.
- Design a relational database for complex queries and transactions.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment.
- Apply best practices in software development, security, and documentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API:** REST and GraphQL
- **Deployment:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Property listing and booking management
- Review system for properties
- Secure and optimized API endpoints
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the server-side logic. Ensures efficient API endpoints, handles authentication, and manages database interactions.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the design, implementation, and optimization of the database. Ensures data integrity, creates indexes, and monitors query performance.

### Frontend Developer
Builds the user interface and ensures smooth interaction between the client side and the backend API. Implements responsive and interactive components.

### DevOps Engineer
Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment environments, and automates testing and deployment processes. Ensures smooth integration and delivery of the application.

### Project Manager
Coordinates team efforts, tracks project milestones, and ensures timely delivery. Acts as a bridge between developers, stakeholders, and clients.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend, handling routing, authentication, and API endpoints.

### PostgreSQL
A relational database system used to store and manage all project data, including users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

### GraphQL
A query language for APIs used to provide flexible and efficient data retrieval between the frontend and backend.

### Docker
A containerization tool that ensures consistent development and production environments across different machines.

### Git & GitHub
Version control system and repository hosting platform for tracking code changes, collaboration, and CI/CD integration.

### RESTful API
Architectural style used to design scalable and maintainable endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Automates testing, building, and deployment of the application to ensure continuous integration and delivery.

### JavaScript / HTML / CSS
Frontend technologies used to build the user interface, implement interactivity, and style the application.

## Database Design

### Key Entities

#### Users
- **Fields:** id, name, email, password, date_joined
- **Description:** Stores all registered users. Each user can make multiple bookings and leave reviews.

#### Properties
- **Fields:** id, owner_id, title, description, location, price_per_night
- **Description:** Stores property details. Each property belongs to a user (owner) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

#### Bookings
- **Fields:** id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, status
- **Description:** Represents a booking made by a user for a property. Each booking belongs to one user and one property.

#### Reviews
- **Fields:** id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, date_created
- **Description:** Stores reviews submitted by users for properties. Each review belongs to one user and one property.

#### Payments
- **Fields:** id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, status
- **Description:** Tracks payment information for bookings. Each payment is linked to a specific booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can view and update personal information, see their bookings, and leave reviews.

### Property Management
Enables property owners to create, update, and delete property listings. Owners can manage property details such as title, description, location, and price.

### Booking System
Handles reservations made by users for available properties. Users can book properties for specific dates, and the system tracks booking status and availability.

### Reviews
Users can submit reviews for properties they have stayed in. Each review includes a rating and comments, helping other users make informed decisions.

### Payment Processing
Tracks payments for bookings securely. Ensures that each payment is linked to a booking, with details such as amount, date, and status.

### Search and Filtering
Provides users with the ability to search for properties based on location, price range, and availability. Improves the overall user experience by allowing targeted searches.


## API Security

### Authentication
Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Users must log in with valid credentials, which helps protect personal information and user accounts.

### Authorization
Controls user permissions and access levels. For example, only property owners can update their property listings, preventing unauthorized changes to data.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. This protects the server from overload and ensures fair usage for all users.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest. This protects user data from interception or breaches.

### Input Validation
All inputs will be validated to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection or XSS. This ensures that malicious data cannot compromise the system.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. CI/CD ensures that code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main branch, while CD allows for reliable and consistent deployment to production or staging environments.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate tests and deployments whenever code is pushed to the repository. **Docker** can be used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Using a CI/CD pipeline helps catch errors early, speeds up the development process, and ensures that the application remains stable and deployable at all times.
